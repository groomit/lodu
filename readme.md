This is a ludo-like game (german: "Mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht") written in JS.
Currently this is an one-computer version. The goal is to be able to play with 4 players online - online multiplayer if you like.

This idea came up during the corona crisis in 2020. I wanted to connect remotely with my friends and play some games together with tem.
